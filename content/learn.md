<h2 class='noTrickPadding' id='r4ds'>R for data science</h2>

The best place to start learning the tidyverse is [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz) (R4DS for short), an O'Reilly book written by Hadley Wickham and Garrett Grolemund. It's designed to take you from knowing nothing about R or the tidyverse to having all the basic tools of data science at your fingertips. You can read it online for free, or [buy a physical copy](http://amzn.to/2aHLAQ1). 

We highly recommend pairing R4DS with the [RStudio cheatsheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/). These cheatsheets have been carefully designed to pack a lot of information into a small amount of space. You can keep them handy at your desk and quickly jog your memory when you get stuck. Most of the cheatsheets have been translated into multiple languages.

* [Writing functions in R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/writing-functions-in-r/)
  by Hadley and Charlotte Wickham, hosted on DataCamp. This course will teach you the fundamentals 
  of writing functions in R so that, among other things, you can make your code 
  more readable, avoid coding errors, and automate repetitive tasks.

* [Data visualisation with ggplot2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-1) by
  Rick Scavetta, hosted on DataCamp. Covers the basics of ggplot2. Followed by [part 2](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/data-visualization-with-ggplot2-2)
  which covers more advanced topics.
 
* [Exploratory data analysis in R: case study](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/exploratory-data-analysis-in-r-case-study) by David Robinson, hosted on DataCamp. This course brings ggplot2 and dplyr to action on a real dataset, also introducing broom for tidying model output and how to tidy up data to help you explore your dataset.

### 2017

* [Data Challenge Lab](https://dcl-2017-04.github.io/curriculum/upcoming.html).
  Stanford University; Hadley Wickham and Bill Behrman. This is a 5-unit
  course using a flipped classroom. The curriculum is designed to cover
  each main thread of R4DS multiple times, diving a little deeper at
  each pass.
 
* [M.Sc. Industrial Analysis: An International Perspective](https://www.drhector.org/course/m-sc-industrial-analysis-an-international-perspective/). HEC Montreal; Thierry Warin. Graduate program in Data Science for International Business (DS4IB), where students learn how to use RStudio, RMardown, the tidyverse and open data in a reproducible research workflow. Hosted at [Dr.HECtoR](http://drhector.org).

* [Better Living with Data Science](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/courses/Fall17/sta112.01/).
  Duke University; Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel. Data Science course for first year undergradiates
  with little to no computing background. Combines techniques from statistics, math, computer 
  science, and social sciences, to learn how to use data to understand natural phenomena, 
  explore patterns, model outcomes, and make predictions. Data wrangling, exploratory data 
  analysis, predictive modeling, data visualization, and effective communication of results. 
  Discussions around reproducibility, data sharing, data privacy.
  
* [Statistical Computing](http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/Sta523_Fa17/) Duke University; 
  Colin Rundel. MS level statistical computing course focusing on Best practices and software 
  development for reproducible results, selecting topics from: use of markup languages, 
  understanding data structures, design of graphics, object oriented programming, 
  vectorized code, scoping, documenting code, profiling and debugging, building modular 
  code, and version control-all in contexts of specific applied statistical analyses. 
  
* [FE8828 Programming Web Applications in Finance]
  (http://www.nbs.ntu.edu.sg/Programmes/Graduate/MScFE/Documents/Website%20MFE%20Course%20Details_2017.pdf)
  Nanyang Technological University; 
  Yang Ye. As a part of Master of Financial Engineering program, this course serves an
  intermediate-to-advanced programming course for data analytics, statistics and
  quantitive finance. We teach the topics of R Markdown, Shiny, and
  Tidyverse packages (dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, lubridate, modelr, bloom).

### 2016

* [Stat545](http://stat545.com); UBC; Jenny Bryan. Data wrangling, 
  exploration, and analysis with R
  
### 2012

* [Stat405](http://stat405.had.co.nz); Hadley Wickham, Rice University.
  Mainly included for historical interest - you can see some of the work
  that lead up to the creation of the tidyverse.
